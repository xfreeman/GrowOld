<b>for Alec</b>
<p>My older son Alec (currently 4) is astutely observant of the world around him, asks a lot of questions about what he sees, and conducts a lot of experiments to help answer those questions. He's extremely interested in how things work.</p>
<p>His fascination with the world naturally extends beyond our planet. He always keeps an eye out for the moon and lets me know what phase it is in, and he often looks for other interesting things in the night sky.</p>
<p>So I started to think about music based on the moon and its phases. I also thought about my own longtime fascination with phasing processes in composition (like in Steve Reich's classic works) where one musical line -- just like an orbiting moon -- spins around in repetition a little faster than another.</p>
<p>Since Earth only has one moon, that didn't make a good foundation for this phasing. But Saturn (Alec's favorite planet) has many, many moons, which proved more fruitful. I found data on seven of Saturn's largest moons -- Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus -- and looked up their orbit period, orbit radius, moon mass, and moon diameter. I used this data to algorithmically drive a repeated, synthesized plucked-string note for each moon. The pitch of the note is based on the orbit radius, and the timbre is based on the moon's mass and diameter. As the moons orbit Saturn at different rates, they fade in and out of prominence, change the speed at which their notes repeat, and change their panning position in the stereo spread. A very low, pure waveform represents Saturn itself, and it changes volume based on Saturn's rotation. Each day, the algorithm generates the music anew, condensing the entire days' movement into a few minutes of music. It takes more than a hundred years before the music repeats exactly the same way.</p>
<p>I don't know what career Alec will eventually pursue: a scientist, a chef, a landscape architect, or something else entirely. I do hope, though, that he always keeps the curiosity of a scientist, the creativity to ask interesting questions and devise experiments to answer them, a sense of wonderment at our small place within the universe, and a passion for sustaining the world around us.</p>
