<b>for Leah</b>
<p>This piece is a reminder that all the details we can sometimes get bogged down in -- kids waking up in the middle of the night, seemingly endless trips to the pediatrician, repairs to our 100-year-old house, a constant deluge of dirty dishes and laundry, and so on -- really don't matter very much. It all fades away when we focus on the love, devotion, and selflessness for our family that have always been at our core. We must always find frequent moments that remind us of the joy we bring each other and that our children bring to us.</p>
<p>I've long been fascinated with mathematically interesting infinite number sequences, and I've often used them as a structural foundation for my music. This music uses <a href="http://oeis.org/A000120" target="_blank">one of my favorite sequences</a> to create a sense of these simple moments continually resurfacing. It starts like this:</p>
<code>0,1,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,2,2,3,2,3,3,4,1,2,2,3,2,3,3,4,2,3,3,4,3,4,4,5,...</code>
<p>The music steps through each number in the sequence in order. As the numbers grow larger, more pitches are played simultaneously. These pitches are part of a harmonic series, and they repeat rhythmically at rates derived from those harmonic relationships, thus creating complex polyrhythmic, microtonal textures as the integers get higher and higher. (This approach was particularly inspired by <a href="http://eamusic.dartmouth.edu/~larry/toim/toim_front.html" target="_blank">Larry Polansky's Psaltery works</a> and by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmicon" target="_blank">Henry Cowell's Rhythmicon</a>.)</p>
<p>As time passes, more and more numbers from the sequence are used to generate the piece, leading to increasingly complex and detailed textures. Yet the sequence, and therefore the music, always takes time to relish in the lower numbers and purer textures with which the piece began.</p>
<p>This integer sequence is closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake" target="_blank">Koch snowflake</a>, a famous fractal pattern whose perimeter is of infinite length. I wasn't thinking of this connection while writing the piece, but in retrospect, I suppose I imagine sitting by a fire with my family, watching snowflakes fall outside, and remembering my infinite blessings.</p>
