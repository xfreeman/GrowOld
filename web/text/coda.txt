<p>It is natural for a composer to want his or her work to survive for a long time. We like to believe that others will value our music enough that they will want to perform and preserve it decades or even centuries into the future. This whole EP, in fact, is rather presumptuous in its assumption that anyone will care about it years into the future. It's also somewhat naive in assuming that the technologies it relies upon today will still be useable far into the future. (I have made conscious decisions designed to maximize the potential for technological longevity, such as posting the source code for each track on the site and relying on an open-source computer music language that has already been around for 30 years. But technological obsolescence moves in quick and unpredictable ways.)</p>
<p>This track attempts to keep my timescale ambitions (and my composerly ego) in check. It gradually self-destructs by decaying slowly and (I hope) gracefully over the course of thirty years.</p>
<p>The music consists of three layers of sound: a single note, a two-note chord below it, and a bass note below that. For each layer, there are three different notes or chords that alternate slowly over the course of the piece. Each layer is also sometimes silent. All three layers are based on recordings of a piano (samples from the <a href="http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html" target="_blank">musical instrument sample database at the University of Iowa Electronic Music Studios</a>). The lowest layer plays these recordings without modification. The upper two layers use a simple granular technique to transform the original recordings dramatically.</p>
<p>Over the course of the piece, the track erases itself. Over time, the upper two layers become silent more frequently, a filter gradually removes more and more of the sound from the piece (starting with the highest frequencies and moving downwards), and there is more and more reverb. By the end, all is silence.</p>
<p>The same process unfolds over the course of thirty years. As time passes, the beginning of the piece becomes more and more similar to the end, increasingly favoring silence and filtering out more sound. By 2044, the entire piece is silence.</p>
