<b>for Jonathan</b>
<p>Jonathan (currently 16 months old) was so fascinated with a Schoenhut toy piano he discovered at a friend's house that we decided to get one of our own. He likes playing it, along with all the drums and maracas and other instruments we have around the house. He also really, really, really likes to dance.</p>
<p>Whenever a baby plays a piano, someone tells me it sounds like avant-garde music. I suppose they mean that it sounds completely random. I tend to disagree, arguing that neither the baby's playing nor avant-garde piano music is usually particularly random. Even in music created by chance techniques, each of us as listeners can usually discover something acutely personal and meaningful if we take just a moment to listen carefully.</p>
<p>This piece is my way of delving further into this idea. I wrote a simple piece for toy piano, a lullaby of sorts, built around an extremely repetitive Db that gradually builds into thick chords before returning to the simple Db.</p>
<p>My code makes a deliberately crude attempt to perform this music as if by a baby, randomly leaving out notes, adding extra notes, changing notes, playing notes at the wrong time, and so on. Each day, the music is performed anew by an ever-so-slightly older child. When Jonathan is young, nearly every note is wrong and the music sounds more like Jonathan's actual performances at the toy piano than the piece I wrote, though I do take some poetic license to mold the wrong notes in the shape of the piece's harmonic structure. As he gets older, there are fewer and fewer errors. The performance becomes virtually flawless when he turns 20. (Jonathan: I'm assuming, for sake of argument, that you will someday learn the piano well enough to be able to play this music. It's a convenient assumption for the sake of this piece. I promise I will not be disappointed if you never study piano.)</p>
<p>I'd be lying if I said I didn't care if my kids made music an important part of their lives. I don't really want, or expect, them to make a career out of music, but I hope they are engaged with music enough for it to continue to bring them joy. I also hope they appreciate the fundamental randomness of both art and life, and look beyond the surface of things to try to find a personal meaning in seeming chaos.</p>
<p>This piece is also inspired by a formative experience in my education as a composer. When I was in my early 20s, I studied composition at a seminar for young composers led by Brian Ferneyhough. The intervening years have likely distorted my memory, but I distinctly remember a story he told about his childhood. He would meticulously construct model airplanes and then gloriously crash them. He was interested not so much in the structure (the airplane) as in the remnants of the structure (the crashed plane) after it had been disturbed and transformed by chaos. I think that's very much what I'm trying to do in this piece too.</p>
<p>The toy piano sounds in this piece are recordings of our own toy piano. A score and recording of the original lullaby are below.</p>
